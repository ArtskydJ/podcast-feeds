# podcast-feeds

This is a repo to host a few podcast feeds for some audio files on the internet that don't have podcast feeds attached. This repo also hosts the source code to generate the feeds.

### to the content owners

If you wish for me to take down the feed(s) pointing to your content, let me know! My contact info is listed [here](https://github.com/ArtskydJ).

Since the audio files are publically visible on the internet for anyone to use anyway, I'm just trying to make it a bit easier for podcast listeners.
